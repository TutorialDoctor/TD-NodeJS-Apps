Make sure you have node installed first.

To run a nodeJS file:

`node <file.js>`

Ex:

`node app.js`

To run the server: 

`node server.js`

To create a package.json file:

`npm init`

This will take you through a series of questions to create metadata for the current project folder.

To install a nodeJS module or package (npm is similar to pip for python):

`npm install <nameOfModule>`

Ex: (ExpressJS is a web app framework similar to flask)

`npm install express`

This will create a new folder named "node_modules" with a folder for the express module inside.
